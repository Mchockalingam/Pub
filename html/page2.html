Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.<br/>Throughout the descent Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170 cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said 'Contact light!' Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said 'Shutdown.' Aldrin immediately said 'Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of detent.' Armstrong acknowledged 'Out of detent. Auto' and Aldrin continued 'Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in.'", width: 500, height:350});
